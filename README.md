# Deep Learning from Scratch

This repo is dedicated to learn and re-learn deep learning from scratch. The 
idea to document the journey to implement deep learning models with as little 
use of libraries as possible, in order to grasp the deep technical expertise 
and confidence to implement a new deep learning or machine learning algorithm 
upon reading a paper.

## Rules
* No usage of high-level APIs from ML libraries; i.e. no tf.keras.Model, no hugging-face, no torch.nn.module
* Create our own deep learning abstractions, CNN, LSTM, embeddings etc.
* Code and model testing are mandatory. PyTest will be used as a default

## Roadmap
* MNIST from numpy scratch
* LeNet for MNIST
* ResNet from torch.tensor
